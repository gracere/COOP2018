Question 55 Algorithm:

Main:
# Import math
# Print introduction
# ask the user to input a number for (variable a)
# ask the user to input a number for (variable b)
# ask the user to input a number for (variable c)
# ask the user to input a number for (variable n)
# If false
#           print "Holy smokes, Fermat was wrong!"(and print that his theory was wrong in this test)
# If true
#       print "No, that does not work. Fermat's theory holds."(and print that his theory was right in this test)
#
check_fermat:
# take variables a,b,c,n from input collected from user
# fermat's theorem: a to the nth power + b to the nth power = c to the nth power
# plug the users input of variables a, b, c, and n into fermat's theorem
# create an if n > 2:
# and create an if n < 2:
# create an true, false statement,
# If true
#       a to the nth power + b to the nth power does not equal c to the nth power,
# if false
#       a to the nth power + b to the nth power does equal c to the nth power, and n is greater than 2
